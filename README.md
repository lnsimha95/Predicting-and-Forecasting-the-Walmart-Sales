# Predicting-and-Forecasting-the-Walmart-Sales
This project uses prediction and forecasting algorithms to analyze the Walmart sales dataset.


# Detailed Problem that Walmart faces

One of the leading retail stores in the US, Walmart, would like to predict the sales and demand accurately. There are certain events and holidays which impact sales on each day. There are sales data available for 45 stores of Walmart. The business is facing a challenge due to unforeseen demands and runs out of stock some times, due to the inappropriate machine learning algorithm. An ideal ML algorithm will predict demand accurately and ingest factors like economic conditions including CPI, Unemployment Index, etc.

Walmart runs several promotional markdown events throughout the year. These markdowns precede prominent holidays, the four largest of all, which are the Super Bowl, Labour Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. The weeks including these holidays are weighted five times higher in the evaluation than non-holiday weeks. Part of the challenge presented by this competition is modeling the effects of markdowns on these holiday weeks in the absence of complete/ideal historical data. Historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores located in different regions are available.

# Shorter and Concise Problem statement


To analyse and predict the demand for 45 Walmart Stories so that it can plan its promotional strategies and markdowns during holiday and non-holiday weeks


# Methodology 

I used numerous prediction algorithms for predicting the Walmart sales like Linear regression, random forest regression, Lasso regression, ridge regression, Simple Gradient boosting regression and XG Boosting regression. And I used Holt Winters Exponential Smoothing time series model to forecast the Walmart Sales as it is a retail dataset that is bound to seasonality.
